# Spiritboard

As this project uses the art for the Ravenloft Spiritboard and Planchette, you'll need to get them yourself and put them in the `src\assets` folder.
Both files are available in the digital version of the book on Dndbeyond.
Wizards also had a free pdf with them, however if you want to use that, you will need to create the pngs yourself and maybe tweak the css.
